= This fork

We just use this fork to publish a build of the xalan jar with the latest bug fixes.

Xalan is very seldomly released. We just publish a build (only of xalan itself) with different coordinates (and version post fixed with a -<number>). So that we can use it in other projects (well, in this case just MMBase).
